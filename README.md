# First-Project
This is my very first project. Just a simple audio player.
In order for this to work,pygame module should be installed on your system.
Music that will be identified as the program start is placed in "Music" folder.
You can also use the menu in program to add music from any directory you want.
Also there is a doc file in repository where I describe the creation of this project,but it is in Russian so few people will find that interesting :)
